This repository is for a function that can display a user's repositories and the number of commits in each.

Below is a badge linked to Circle-ci ensuring the build is successful and that my tests pass:

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/JGrant225/SSW-567-HW-00b/tree/HW03a_Mocking.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/JGrant225/SSW-567-HW-00b/tree/HW03a_Mocking)

When designing the code, I thought it was not only important to make the intended outcome clear, but also the path resulting in error messages. By making the error statements concise as well as the conditions that lead to each error, it became easier to focus on what scenarios to test for. When testing this assignment, I initially struggled with figuring out how to properly store the output of the function to match the expected output in string form. Additionally, I struggled with matching the syntax of the expected output with the actual output in the "test_output_valid_user" test function.
