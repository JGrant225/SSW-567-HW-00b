After writing and remembering rules for classifying triangles, I did not encounter many challenges during this assignment. However, my initial classifyTriangle.py file did include a syntax error, which had to be fixed before testing. The requirements specification for this assignment were clear and I believe I was able to write a function that meets its description. As I have tested using Python;s UnitTest frameworkd before, I did not encounter challenges with the tools. To determine that I had suffecient test cases, I ensured that every possible user input scenario was represented in the test file.
